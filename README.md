Style Guide for Antarctica Code Syntax Guidelines

Antarctica is cold. It's one of the coldest places on Earth, and the scientists who travel there spend most of their time inside their Base. The base is where most of their experiments, functions, and operations take place. 

```bash

/*********************************************
<---------------Base Width------------------->
*********************************************/
const      BOTH_SELECTED = true              ;
const  SYSTEMJS_SELECTED = 0                 ;
const REQUIREJS_SELECTED = 1                 ;
            var selected = REQUIREJS_SELECTED;
/*############################################
<--                      ^                 -->
                         |                    
                         |                    
                 Base Spines                
*###########################################*/
```

Since it's cold even in Base, operations must be executed in the most efficient way possible, along what I call Spines, to preserve precious heat.

Tab spaces are limited to 2 spaces to preserve the limited space in a Base.

Note: Since GitHub does not allow global tab sizes to be set, Base Width is measured in multiples of 8. 

Note: Base Width is normally generated by combining the distance between Base Spines from the longest distance from one spine to the next with only necessary spaces. (Spine 1 to 2 is the width of the "const REQUIREJS_SELECTED" + the width of "REQUIREJS_SELECTED" because each section of each line is the widest possible with only minimal spaces). However, Base Width defers to a tab size of 8.


Spine delimiters follow this rule:
Single or solo character delimiters ('=', for example) take precedence in defining a Spine position over the Spine positions composed of double character delimiters ({} for example). Double character delimiters take precedence over defining a Spine position of triple character delimiters (var), and so forth.
```bash
=
?
:
;
''
""
{}
[]
()
* any single character operator.
* the beginning or end character any keywords.
* the first character of any word, number, or 
  symbol preceeded by another Spine delimiter.
* the last character of any word, number, or 
  symbol suffixed by another Spine delimiter.
* It is preferred for the semicolons to be 
  aligned as the last Spine.
```

Time is rarely spent outside of the Base except to perform operations that are necessarily outside of the scope of Base.
```bash
  switch (selected)      {
  									 case(SYSTEMJS_SELECTED): {
                                                Perform.necesary(operation);
                                                break                      ;
                                              }                            ;
                         }                                                 ;
```

However, most of the time, experiments, functions, and operations that are too large and costly in heat are performed in-house.

```bash
                    case(REQUIREJS_SELECTED):{


  var performance = function (input1, input2,
                    input3)  {
                              input3 = input1 
                                     + input2                              ;
                              //        
                              // or
                              input3          =            input1 + input2 ;
                             }                                             ;
  var predictor   = input3   * input2                                      ;
  break                                                                    ;

                                            }                              ;
```

These operations are given space, two lines above and below each code block, and one indent for each level of depth. Tab width can be traded for more new lines and vice versa.

It's allowable for non-Antarctica coding styles to used on in-house operations.

```bash
                    case(REQUIREJS_SELECTED): {
  var performance = function (input1, input2, input3)  
                    {
                      input3 = input1 + input2;
                      //        
                      // or
                      input3 = input1 + input2;
                    };
                      //
                      // or
  var performance = function (input1, input2, input3) {
      input3 = input1 + input2;
    }
  var predictor = input3 * input2;
  break;
};
```
But it doesn't look as good.

It's also possible to make as many Bases as one desires, and subBases as well.
```bash
// Todo for showing how to make subBases.
```
