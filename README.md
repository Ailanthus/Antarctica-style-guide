Style Guide for Antarctica Code Syntax

Warning: Antarctica only works for whitespace-agnostic languages,
excluding: Python, CoffeeScript.

```bash
I want noncoders to feel about code the way I feel about code.
```

Inspiration:
Coding style from Famo.us 0.3 from Famous Industries.

Goals:
* Capitalize on larger screen sizes and resolutions.
* improve modular thinking and readability.
* Make code less claustrophobic and allow it to breathe.
* Normal people hate the way code looks. Antarctica will encourage more engagement in the coding arts.
* Minimize the seriousness of organization (function declaration, keywords) by giving organizational syntax a floaty, warm, airy feel using lots of newlines.
* maximize execution readability by stressing it's importance through wide open space.


Noncoders can't read the way code is now. Standard indentation is fine for reading code but not for sharing it. We live in a sharing world. We share code between teams, with our employers, with unknown people on github.

We are visual creatures. We are attracted to aesthetically pleasing things, and code is all but that. It's rigid, and it stresses organization over aesthetics. Noncoders don't want to look at it. It's cold.

Antarctica is cold. It's one of the coldest places on Earth, and the researchers who travel there spend most of their time inside their Base. The base is where most of their experiments, functions, and operations take place.

From what I've seen about life in Antarctica, people endeavor to be warm in disposition to each other, share resources welcomely. Code should endeavor to be warm. Code should be shared welcomely. Organization, while crucial, is handled with compassion in mind. Code's organization should be compassionate to its reader.

```bash

/*********************************************
<---------------Base Width------------------->
*********************************************/
const      BOTH_SELECTED = true              ;
const  SYSTEMJS_SELECTED = 0                 ;
const REQUIREJS_SELECTED = 1                 ;
            var selected = REQUIREJS_SELECTED;
/*#######################^####################
<--                      |                 -->
                         |
                         |
                 Base Spines
*###########################################*/
```

Since it's cold even in Base, operations must be executed in the most efficient way possible, along what I call Spines, to preserve precious heat.

Tab spaces are limited to 2 spaces to preserve the limited space in a Base.

Note: Since GitHub does not allow global tab sizes to be set yet, Base Width is measured in multiples of 8.

Note: Base Width is normally generated by combining the distance between Base Spines from the longest distance from one spine to the next with only necessary spaces. (Spine 1 to 2 is the width of the "const REQUIREJS_SELECTED" + the width of "REQUIREJS_SELECTED" because each section of each line is the widest possible with only minimal spaces). However, Base Width defers to a tab size of 8.


Spine delimiters follow this rule:
Single or solo character delimiters ('=', for example) take precedence in defining a Spine position over the Spine positions composed of double character delimiters ({} for example). Double character delimiters take precedence over defining a Spine position of triple character delimiters (var), and so forth.
Double character delimiters must be aligned with one another.
```bash
=
+
-
*
/
%
?
:
;
''
""
{}
[]
()
* any single character operator.
* the beginning or end character any keywords.
* the first character of any word, number, or
  symbol preceeded by another Spine delimiter.
* the last character of any word, number, or
  symbol suffixed by another Spine delimiter.
* It is preferred for the semicolons to be
  aligned as the last Spine.
* Increment and decrement operators are not
  considered delimiters.


Time is rarely spent outside of the Base except to perform operations that are necessary outside the scope of Base.
```bash
  switch (selected) {
                     case(SYSTEMJS_SELECTED): {
                                                Perform.necessary(operation);
                                                break                       ;
                                              }                             ;
                    }                                                       ;
```

However, most of the time, experiments, functions, and operations that are too large and costly in heat are performed in-house.

```bash
                    case(REQUIREJS_SELECTED):{


  var performance = function (input1, input2,
                    input3)  {
                              input3 = input1
                                     + input2                              ;
                              //
                              // or
                              input3          =            input1 + input2 ;
                             }                                             ;
  var predictor   = input3   * input2                                      ;
  break                                                                    ;

                                            }                              ;
```

These operations are given space, two lines above and below each code block, and one indent for each level of depth. Tab width can be traded for more new lines and vice versa.

It's allowable for non-Antarctica coding styles to form in-house operations.

```bash
                    case(REQUIREJS_SELECTED): {
  var performance = function (input1, input2, input3)  
                    {
                      input3 = input1 + input2;
                      //
                      // or
                      input3 = input1 + input2;
                    };
                      //
                      // or
  var performance = function (input1, input2, input3) {
      input3 = input1 + input2;
    }
  var predictor = input3 * input2;
  break;
};
```
Bases and subBases
It's also possible to make as many Bases as one desires, and subBases as well but they must be delimited by a comment block and two lines with indentation.
Furthermore, semi-colons must either conform to "semi-colon as last Spine" methodology or "semi-colon immediately after statement" with each subBase.
Block depths greater than 2 must follow and odd-even indentation (3 = odd, 4 = even) with lines above and below in multiples of 2.

```bash
function a(b, c, function() {
                             var d = function (e, f) {


/****************************
first comment block*********/

function e (f, g, h) {


                            /****************************
                            second comment block********/
function i (j, k, l)
  {


    if (1 + 1 == 2) {
console.log('All is right with the universe');
                    }
      else            {
console.log('Something is seriously wrong here!');
                      }
  }
                             /****************************
                             closing second comment block*
                             ****************************/
                     }
/****************************
closing first comment block
****************************/

                                                     }

                            });
```

If-else and Switch-case statements
If-else
and
Switch-case
may be formatted by including white space to the end of the delimiter.
```bash
if (1)
      else
          performance(input1, input2, input3)                              ;
switch (both_selected) {
                        case BOTH_SELECTED: {
                                             console.log("Out damn spot!") ;
                                            }
                        case NONE_SELECTED: {

console.log('Whew')                       ;
console.log('That was tough')             ;

                                            }
                       }
```
